                    <li>Sift the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda into a large bowl.</li>
                    <li>
                        Beat the butter and brown sugar in another large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high
                        speed until pale and fluffy, about 4 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.
                        (Use the paddle attachment for a stand mixer.) Beat in the eggs one at a time, then beat in the
                        vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low. Add the dry ingredients and beat until combined. Stir in
                        the chocolate chips by hand.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the dough and refrigerate at least 1 hour or
                        preferably overnight.
                    </li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
                    <li>
                        Use a 1-ounce ice cream scoop to scoop half the dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing
                        about 2 inches apart. Chill the remaining dough while you bake the first batch.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bake until the cookies are golden around the edges but still soft in the middle, 12 to 15
                        minutes. Let the cookies cool for 10 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer them to a wire
                        rack to cool completely. Cool the baking sheets completely, then line with parchment paper again
                        if necessary and repeat the scooping and baking process with the remaining dough.

                <h5>Directions</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with foil, leaving an overhang
                        on 2 sides; spray lightly with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For the crust: Add the flour, cornstarch, confectioners' sugar and salt to the bowl of a food
                        processor and pulse 10 times until combined. Add the cold butter and pulse until the mixture
                        looks like coarse sand, about 30 times. (The dough will not come together in one mass.) Sprinkle
                        the mixture evenly in the prepared pan and lightly pat it down. Bake, rotating the pan halfway
                        through, until golden brown around the edges, 20 to 25 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For the filling: Combine the eggs, yolks, sugar, flour, salt and lemon juice in a medium
                        saucepan. Whisk continuously over medium heat, occasionally scraping down the sides and edges of
                        the pan with a rubber spatula, until simmering and thickened, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the
                        heat and whisk in the lemon zest and butter until combined.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lower the oven temperature to 300 degrees F. Pour the filling over the crust and bake until just
                        set, 12 to 15 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place on a wire rack to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until cold, about 2 hours.

                    <li>
                        Use the foil overhang to lift the bars from the pan. Remove the foil and slice into squares.
                        Dust with confectioners' sugar just before serving.

                <h5>Directions</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        For the cake: Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Coat two
                        9-inch round cake pans with nonstick cooking spray. Line the bottoms with parchment paper
                        rounds and lightly coat the paper with spray.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cover the raisins with very hot water and let sit until plump, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain.</li>
                    <li>
                        Toast the pecans on a rimmed baking sheet until fragrant and browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool,
                        and then chop 1 cup of the pecans; reserve for the cake batter. Pulse the remaining 1/2 cup
                        pecans in a food processor until very finely ground; reserve for garnish.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Combine the carrots and buttermilk in a medium bowl. Whisk the flour, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg,
                        baking powder, salt and baking soda in a large bowl. Beat the eggs, brown sugar and vanilla
                        extract in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until pale and thick, about 4
                        minutes. Reduce the speed to medium-low and gradually stream in the oil. Add the dry ingredients
                        in 3 additions, alternating with the carrot mixture, beginning and ending with dry ingredients.
                        Mix until smooth. Fold in the raisins and chopped pecans with a rubber spatula. Scrape the
                        batter evenly into the prepared pans.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bake the cakes, rotating the pans halfway through, until a toothpick inserted into the center of
                        each cake comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. Transfer the pans to a wire rack and let the cakes
                        cool for 10 minutes. Run a knife around the sides of the cakes and invert onto the rack. Remove
                        the parchment and let the cakes cool completely.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For the frosting: Beat the cream cheese and butter in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on
                        high speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the speed to low and
                        gradually mix in the confectioner' sugar. Increase the speed to high and beat until the frosting
                        until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To assemble the cake: When the cakes are completely cool, trim the domes of each cake round with
                        a large serrated knife so the tops are flat. Place one cake, cut-side down, on a platter. Spread
                        1 1/2 cups of the frosting evenly over top. Place the remaining cake, cut-side down, on top.
                        Spread the top with another 1 1/2 cups of the frosting. Frost the sides of the cake with another
                        1 1/2 cups frosting and smooth out completely to make an even crumb coat (It's ok if some of the
                        cake shows through. This is just a base layer.) Refrigerate for 30 minutes to let the frosting
                        set.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Spread the remaining frosting over the top and sides of the cake, swirling decoratively if
                        desired. Sprinkle with the finely ground pecans.
