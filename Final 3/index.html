                <h2>My Family</h2>
                <p>
                    My family is very important to me and is a big part of my life. I live with my mom, dad, and
                    brother. We also have one dog, named Willow, and a cat, named Ollie. My brother just graduated high
                    school and is going into college. My mom is a graphic designer and makes logos for many companies.
                    My dad is a math and science dean at Sheridan College. My family helps me learn in new ways and
                    supports me along the way. My grandpa helps coach baseball and my grandma loves coming to watch me
                    at games.

                <h2>Activities/Hobbies</h2>
                <p>
                    I am very interested in sports and other hobbies in my life. I play basketball, baseball, and golf.
                    In the winter was my freshman basketball season for the high school and my coaches helped develop me
                    as a player and character. I am currently in baseball season, my favorite sport. Baseball takes up a
                    lot of my time in the summer playing with my friends and team. I also love to golf whenever I can
                    and might play for the team this fall. I'm also interested in other hobbies including traveling,
                    fishing, umpiring, and just spending time outside.

                <h2>More About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I take pride in my work and grades in school. I am just finishing up my freshman year in high
                    school. I am a straight A student and in many accelerated classes. I also enjoy just laughing and
                    spending time with my friends at school. I work hard in everything I do and am deternined to finish
                    something I start. When I grow up, I hope to be a sports journalist in either baseball, basketball, or football. I
                    love watching sports games and would like to go into a job involved with sports.
