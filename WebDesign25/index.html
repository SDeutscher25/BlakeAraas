        <h3>What Am I Interested In?</h3>
        <p>
            I am interested in many sports including basketball, baseball, and golf. I also take passion in school and
            making sure my grades are always doing good. I also love watching sports and it's even better when I get to
            go to games in person. I think traveling around to different places and seeing new things is also very
            interesting. I also love spending time with my family.

        <h4>My Hobbies & Interests</h4>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>
                <strong>Basketball</strong>: I have been playing basketball all of my life and think it's a great way to
                get active. I think getting out to play just relieves a lot of stress off of me and helps me have fun.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Baseball</strong>: I've also been playing baseball for most of my life. I think I have found my
                love in the sport because my dad and grandpa both inspired me by the stories they always told of when
                they played. I also love just getting out in the warm sun in the summer and just play.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Traveling</strong>: I love traveling to new places and seeing new things. I think it is cool how
                many different activities there are that you can do in different places. I love traveling to warm places
                like Mexico and California where there are beaches and water side activities to do. But I also love just
                traveling to go watch a sports game somewhere. I think traveling in an airplane is a fun experience too.

        <h5>My Future Goals</h5>
        <p>
            My dream is to be a sports journalist or to do something involved in sports when I grow up. I'm really
            interested in writing and have a passion for watching sports so I think it would be the perfect job to get
            to write about the sports I watch and share my opinions on different things. I am a big Gonzaga basketball
            fan so I'm hoping I can go to Gonzaga University for college. I do think Wyoming would also be a good option
            since it is close to home. I hope to become succesful as a person by helping out and giving back to the
            community and to start a family of my own. If I become a sports journalist, I hope to travel around to a lot
            of different sports games. One of my goals is to attend all 30 MLB stadiums in my life and visit some of the
            best college basketball arenas.
