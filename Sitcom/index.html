                <p>
                    John Booker Routledge (also known as John B) is the main protagonist in Outer Banks. He is portrayed
                    by Chase Stokes. He is the charismatic leader of the Pogues crew. His father went missing while
                    trying to salvage a sunken ship, and he will stop at nothing to uncover the secrets behind his
                    disappearance. John B convinces his friends to join him on the epic search for his father, and what
                    his father was looking for, leading them on a life-changing summer adventure with good and bad
                    obstacles along the way. He is actually called little John John a few times by Ward and Sarah. }
                </p>

                <p>
                    John B is seventeen years old and grew up as a Pogue on the poor side of Outer Banks, also known as
                    The Cut. Nine months prior to the Pilot, John B's father went missing at sea and was presumed dead,
                    but his body was never found. John B remains convinced however that his father is still alive. He
                    had been living with his uncle following his father's disappearance, but his uncle, known as uncle T
                    left three months prior to the pilot to build houses in Mississippi. John B is the leader of his
                    friend group, The Pogues. This group consists of JJ, who has been John B's best friend since the 3rd
                    grade, Pope, and Kiara.

                <h3>Who is Sarah Cameron?</h3>
                <p>
                    Sarah Elizabeth Cameron-Routledge is one of the main characters in Outer Banks. She is portrayed by
                    Madelyn Cline. Sarah is popular, wealthy and described as a ‘Kook Princess.’ Despite the odds, she
                    catches the eye of John B, becoming involved in the Pogue's adventures and eventually marrying him.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sarah grew up on Figure Eight Island, and is considered a "Kook". Her father is a self-made
                    entrepreneur and built the family business from the ground up. Sarah describes him as being like
                    John B when he was younger. Sarah has an older brother, Rafe, and a younger sister, Wheezie. She
                    lives with her father and her stepmother, Rose, with whom she has a relatively strained
                    relationship. At the beginning of season one, she is close to her father and says that she can't
                    imagine life without him. In the ninth grade, Sarah was best friends with Kiara for a short time,
                    but the friendship ended abruptly when Sarah began to feel claustrophobic in the friendship. She has
                    had a number of boyfriends in the past but no relationship ever lasted. This, Sarah tells John B, is
                    because she finds herself pushing boys away whenever she starts to get serious with them. Prior to
                    the pilot, she started going out with Topper, who is also a Kook. Sarah is interested in the
                    environment and has an easy-going and fun-loving attitude.

                <h3>JJ Maybank</h3>
                <img src="jj.png" alt="JJ" />
                <h3>Who is JJ?</h3>
                <p>
                    Jackson “JJ” Maybank (born Jackson Groff) was one of the main characters in Outer Banks. He is
                    portrayed by Rudy Pankow. JJ was the loose cannon in The Pogues. He's the latest in a “long line of
                    fishing, drinking, vendetta-holding salt-lifers who made their living off the water.” John B
                    describes him as the “best surfer [he] knows.” JJ was erratic and often didn’t think before he
                    acted. He was feisty and quick-tempered but also always up for a laugh and an adventure. He was
                    sometimes a liability but is also brave and loyal to a fault, always ready to look out for and
                    defend his friends at any turn. Since the end of season 3, JJ dated fellow Pogue member, Kiara
                    Carrera until his death in the end of season 4.
                </p>

                <p>
                    JJ has had a troubled home life. His father Luke is an alcoholic and a drug addict (We first see
                    Luke leaving Barry's place before we know that he's JJ's father. [1]) Luke can't hold down a
                    legitimate job and it is insinuated that he is part of nefarious deals around the OBX. He also
                    physically and mentally abuses JJ. His mother never appears but his father does mention that she
                    left, blaming JJ for it. His father often has frequent violent outbursts which has led to JJ's own
                    struggles with violent behaviour. He is John B's oldest friend, having been friends with him since
                    the third grade. However, later in the series it is revealed that his life as he knew it was all one
                    big giant lie.

                <h3>Pope Heyward</h3>
                <img src="pope.png" alt="Pope"/>
                <h3>Who is Pope?</h3>
                <p>
                    Pope Heyward is one of the main characters in Outer Banks. He is portrayed by Jonathan Daviss. He is
                    the smartest of the Pogues and has a scholarship on the line — his ticket to a life outside of the
                    Outer Banks. John B describes Pope as 'the brains on the operation'. Although Pope is always up for
                    an adventure with his friends, he is also the cautionary voice in the group. He is constantly
                    thinking of possible consequences to their actions and warns the group when he feels that they are
                    about to do something stupid. His warnings, however, often fall on deaf ears.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Pope lives on the poorer side of town known as The Cut. His father owns and runs Heywards, a seafood
                    store, which provides seafood for the entire island. Pope's father, Heyward is a legendary character
                    in Outer Banks who can provide anything for anyone on the island. Pope is described by John B as a
                    bit of a weirdo at times or an oddball but also the smartest person he knows. Pope is under a lot of
                    pressure from his father to excel in academics, his dream is to study medicine.
