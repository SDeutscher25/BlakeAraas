                The Hulk is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer
                Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in the debut issue of The Incredible Hulk
                (May 1962). In his comic book appearances, the character, who has dissociative identity disorder (DID),
                is primarily represented by the alter ego Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking, and muscular humanoid
                possessing a limitless degree of physical strength, and the alter ego Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a
                physically weak, socially withdrawn, and emotionally reserved physicist, both of whom typically resent
                each other.

                Following his accidental exposure to gamma rays while saving the life of Rick Jones during the
                detonation of an experimental bomb, Banner is physically transformed into the Hulk when subjected to
                emotional stress, at or against his will. This transformation often leads to destructive rampages and
                conflicts that complicate Banner's civilian life. The Hulk's level of strength is usually conveyed
                proportionate to his anger level. Commonly portrayed as a raging savage, the Hulk has been represented
                with other alter egos, from a mindless, destructive force (War) to a brilliant warrior (World-Breaker),
                a self-hating protector (the Devil Hulk), a genius scientist in his own right (Doc Green), and a
                gangster (Joe Fixit).

                Despite Hulk and Banner's desire for solitude, the character has a large supporting cast. This includes
                Banner's love interest Betty Ross, his best friend, Rick Jones, his cousin She-Hulk, and therapist and
                ally Doc Samson. In addition, the Hulk alter ego has many key supporting characters, like his
                co-founders of the superhero team the Avengers, his queen Caiera, fellow warriors Korg and Miek, and
                sons Skaar and Hiro-Kala. However, his uncontrollable power has brought him into conflict with his
                fellow heroes and others. Despite this, he tries his best to do what's right while battling villains
                such as the Leader, the Abomination, the Absorbing Man, and more.

                Lee stated that the Hulk's creation was inspired by a combination of Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
                Hyde.[4] Although the Hulk's coloration has varied throughout the character's publication history, the
                usual color is green.

                One of the most iconic characters in popular culture,[5][6] the character has appeared on a variety of
                merchandise, such as clothing and collectable items, inspired real-world structures (such as theme park
                attractions), and been referenced in several media. Banner and the Hulk have been adapted into
                live-action, animated, and video game incarnations.
