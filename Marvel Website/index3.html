                Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Co-created by
                writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and
                Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1963, and received his own title
                with Iron Man #1 in 1968. Shortly after his creation, Iron Man was a founding member of a superhero
                team, the Avengers, with Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk. Iron Man stories, individually and with the
                Avengers, have been published consistently since the character's creation.

                Iron Man is the superhero persona of Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark, a businessman and engineer who runs
                the company Stark Industries. Beginning his career as a weapons manufacturer, he is captured in a war
                zone, and his heart is severely injured by shrapnel. To sustain his heart and escape his captors, he
                builds a technologically advanced armor. After escaping, he continues using the armor as a superhero,
                creating more advanced models that grant him superhuman strength, flight, energy projection, and other
                abilities. The character was used to explore political themes, and early Iron Man stories were set in
                the Cold War. Later stories explored other themes, such as civil unrest, technological advancement,
                corporate espionage, alcoholism, and governmental authority.
