            Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December
            25[a] as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A liturgical feast
            central to Christianity, Christmas preparation begins on the First Sunday of Advent and it is followed by
            Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night. Christmas
            Day is a public holiday in many countries, is observed religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as
            celebrated culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the annual holiday season.

            The traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of Jesus, says
            that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies. When Joseph and Mary arrived in
            the city, the inn had no room, and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with
            angels proclaiming this news to shepherds, who then spread the word.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are different hypotheses regarding the date of Jesus's birth. In the early fourth century, the church
            fixed the date as December 25, the date of the winter solstice in the Roman Empire. It is nine months after
            Annunciation on March 25, also the Roman date of the spring equinox. Most Christians celebrate on December
            25 in the Gregorian calendar, which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in
            countries throughout the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, part of the Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian
            calendar, which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar. For Christians, celebrating
            that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of humanity is more important than
            knowing Jesus's exact birth date.

                    word for Christmas Eve. Gift-givers give entire packages of apples to loved ones for Christmas.
